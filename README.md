# SJTU_GVI
A GNSS-Visual-IMU Dataset for SLAM

Authors: Jie Yin

Different from M2DGR, this dataset has following features:

1.More light-weight and easy for downloading.

2.Recoreded on a real car with high speed.

3.GNSS raw measurements are captured by a Ublox ZED-F9P receiver, which facilitate the GNSS-SLAM research.

Please give us a star if this project is helpful to your research. Thank you!
